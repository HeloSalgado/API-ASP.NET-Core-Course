# API Development with ASP.NET Core

This repository contains the project I developed during my learning journey in **ASP.NET Core**. Through this project, I practiced and applied the knowledge gained about building RESTful APIs.

## What I Learned

During the course, I learned how to:

- Set up an ASP.NET Core Web API from scratch
- Create and manage **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Connect to a database using **Entity Framework Core**
- Implement data validation and ensure data integrity
- Version APIs for smoother transitions during development
- **Work with Migrations** to manage database changes and schema updates

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The main framework used to build the API
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database interactions and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- **MySQL**: The relational database used in the project

## Project Overview

The API performs common operations such as retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting resources (CRUD). Key components include:

- **Controllers**: To handle requests and responses.
- **Models**: To define the structure and validation of data.
- **Database Access**: Using Entity Framework to connect to and manipulate the database.
